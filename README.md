# 📊 Overstimulation Behavior & Lifestyle Analysis

Welcome to my capstone data science project, where I explored how lifestyle habits such as screen time, sleep, stress levels, and mindfulness relate to **overstimulation**.

This project combines data analysis, machine learning, and visualization to uncover the most influential behavioral factors affecting mental overload—and suggests practical changes that can help improve well-being.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- **Dataset:** 2,000 records from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/miadul/overstimulation-behavior-and-lifestyle-dataset)
- **Goal:** Predict and explain what lifestyle behaviors lead to a person becoming overstimulated.
- **Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Tableau, PowerPoint

---

## 🧠 Key Findings

- Individuals who are overstimulated **sleep significantly less** and **use screens more**.
- **High stress and overthinking** are positively linked to overstimulation.
- **Healthy habits** like regular exercise, meditation, and sleep quality help reduce overstimulation risk.
